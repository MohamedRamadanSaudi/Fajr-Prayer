# Fajr Prayer Tracker

## Overview

The **Fajr Prayer Tracker** is a side project developed to help my friends and me stay consistent with our Fajr prayers. It serves as the backend for a **Flutter mobile app** and a **React admin dashboard**. The backend is built using **NestJS** and provides APIs for user management, prayer tracking, and admin functionalities.

This project is a personal initiative to encourage accountability and consistency in our spiritual practices. It is a meaningful tool for us to support each other in maintaining discipline.
